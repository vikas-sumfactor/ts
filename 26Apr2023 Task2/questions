1. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

2. Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

3. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest palindromic substring.

4. Write a function that takes a sorted array of integers and a target integer as input and returns the index of the target integer in the array, or -1 if it does not exist. You cannot use the built-in indexOf or findIndex methods.

5. Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other, where an operation is defined as either adding, deleting, or replacing a character.

6. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a valid palindrome after removing exactly one character, and false otherwise.

7. Write a function that takes two arrays of integers as input and returns a new array containing the common elements of both arrays, sorted in ascending order.

8. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if the string can be rearranged to form a palindrome, and false otherwise.

9. Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum subarray sum, where a subarray is defined as a contiguous subsequence of the original
 array.

10. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if it is a valid IPv4 address in dot-decimal notation, and false otherwise.
